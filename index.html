      Hi, my name is Eric Zell. I am a Software Engineer with a passion for solving
      complex and challenging problems using code. Based in the Boston area, I am a full-stack developer
      with an affinity for designing and implementing efficient back-end solutions. The thing
      I find appealing about back-end development is reading, analyzing, and manipulating data.
      The technologies I feel most comfortable with include Ruby, Ruby on Rails, SQL, and JavaScript.
      However, I have also built some fun projects using C and Python.
      My current interests include performance optimization, data-science, and machine-learning.
      Please check out my Projects page for a sample of my work!
