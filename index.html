        <p>
          Hi, my name is Eric Zell. I am a Software Engineer with a passion for solving
          complex and challenging problems using code. Based in the Boston area, I am a full-stack developer
          with an interest in cloud hosted infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
          I developed a love for coding because I have a real enthusiasm for reading, analyzing, and manipulating data.
          The technologies I feel most comfortable with include Ruby, Ruby on Rails, SQL, and JavaScript.
          However, I have also built some fun projects using C and Python.
          My current interests include performance optimization, working with big data, and writing scalable code.
          Please scroll down to check out a sample of my work!

          At One Door I deliver reliable, scalable, and performant software for
          One Door’s cloud based enterprise application, Merchandising Cloud.
          As a member of a scrum team, I contribute during all phases of
          feature development, from defining requirements, to deployment, and beyond.
          Some of my responsibilities have included:
          <ul class="bullet-points">
            <li>
              Developing a Ruby on Rails back-end API to support an Ember.JS front-end, adhering to REST principles
            </li>
            <li>
              Improving application performance by optimizing SQL queries and object instantiation within legacy code

        <p>
          As a Mechanical Engineer in NUWC’s Electromagnetic Systems Department,
          I was able to take ownership of much of the department's software development needs.
          I became the project lead on ‘Low Cost Stabilization System for Antenna and Optical Platforms’,
          which entailed developing a custom, low cost Inertial Navigation System prototype
          for use within a High Data Rate Antenna. Software Development tasks included:
          <ul class="bullet-points">
            <li>
              Creating an embedded application to read raw sensor data from inertial measurement sensors
            </li>
            <li>
              Implementing a data-fusion algorithm utilizing a Kalman filter to fuse inertial measurement data with the ship's navigation data
            </li>
            <li>
              Establishing a TCP/IP interface to transmit processed data to the antenna's controller

        <p>
          My love for solving challenging problems with code started while earning
          my Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering at The University of Rhode Island.
          My Master's Thesis, 'Cooperative Autonomous Mobile Robots in a Shared Workspace'
          allotted numerous coding challenges to tackle. I implemented Localization and Mapping for autonomous
          mobile robots using a fusion of dead-reckoning and a primitive form of computer-vision (that
          involved mounting a web-cam on the ceiling of the lab). Navigation of the autonomous mobile robots
          was achieved by implementing a Potential Field navigation algorithm and PID Motor control.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a Research Assistant, I also helped develop a Windows desktop application that interfaced
          with various motors and sensors which allowed undergraduate students to perform
          mechanical engineering experimentation at home.

          Machine Learning Baseball is a Python web application that employs machine learning techniques
          to predict pitcher vs. batter matchups of Major League Baseball games. This application was
          my final project for Harvard CS50, which I completed in Spring 2018 through the Harvard Extension School.
          Beginning with a sparse matrix of available pitcher vs. batter statistics, Low Rank Matrix Factorization
          was used to generate a fully populated matrix which predicts statistics for every possible matchup.
          A Python Flask web application was created to display the resulting data in an easy-to-use interface.

        <p>
          First to Know is a Ruby on Rails web application where users can subscribe to receive text message alerts
          when a selected twitter user tweets a certain phrase. For example, perhaps
          you want to be the first to know when Papa John's is giving away free pizza. You can create a
          subscription to Papa John's twitter account for the phrase 'free pizza'. As soon as Papa John's
          tweets anything containing the string 'free pizza', a text message will be sent to the user's
          provided phone number within minutes.

          Chchchanges is a Ruby gem that makes it easy for a team of developers to keep a consistent,
          detailed Changelog. With chchchanges, users can create CHANGELOG entries from the command line.
          Each entry is saved as an individual .json file which prevents CHANGELOG merge conflicts.
